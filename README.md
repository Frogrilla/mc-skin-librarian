## Mc Skin Librarian

Mc Skin Librarian is a java application which allows finer control over your Minecraft launcher's skin library.
It allows you to re-arrange and modify all the skins found in the launcher_custom_skins.json file.
The Minecraft launcher needs to be restarted in order for your library to update.
